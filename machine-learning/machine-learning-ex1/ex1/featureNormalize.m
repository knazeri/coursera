function [X_norm, mu, sigma] = featureNormalize(X)
%   FEATURENORMALIZE Normalizes the features in X 
%   FEATURENORMALIZE(X) returns a normalized version of X where
%   the mean value of each feature is 0 and the standard deviation
%   is 1. This is often a good preprocessing step to do when
%   working with learning algorithms.

X_norm = X;
mu = zeros(1, size(X, 2));
sigma = zeros(1, size(X, 2));

for i=1:size(X, 2)
    mu(i) = mean(X(:,1));
    sigma(i) = std(X(:,i));
end;
